Financial Calculation Terminal Program üíª
Welcome to the Financial Calculation Terminal Program repository! This project was born out of my passion for finance and programming while studying Financial Calculus at university. These two Python programs are designed to help you quickly verify financial exercises, offering a practical and hands-on approach to understanding complex financial concepts.
